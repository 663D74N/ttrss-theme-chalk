ttrss-theme-chalk 
================= 

** Updates for v1.12 **

TT-RSS changed a few things that broke this theme in recent versions (currently on v1.12.1).  That's been corrected now along with a few minor changes to the theme.  If you're still using ttrss version 1.8 you can checkout the tag "ttrss-v1.8".

* Fixes broken icons
* Brings back the sidebar collapse control
* Removes the floating title
* Changed styling for main toolbar above articles
* Screenshot updated
